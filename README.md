The Second Coming
====================
by William Butler Yeats
--------------


Turning and turning in the widening gyre

The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

we're cooking with has (online)

and now local changes!

Surely some revelation is at hand;

Surely the Second Coming is at hand.

A local change that I will commit

I have no poetry to add so here's a random change! Nice original work here 

HELLO IAN :)
